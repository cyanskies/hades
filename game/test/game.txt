#each mod archive can have a game and mod yaml file.
#if loaded as a game the engine will use game
#if loaded as a mod the engine will use mod

#only one game can be loaded per engine instance.
#for a game.yaml, the mods dependencies are auto loaded

mod:
	name:
	#global names used in the document are only resolved to dependencies listed here
	dependencies:
		- dependency1

#the rest of the yaml is parsed as resources
#games register a resource handler to handle sections

#eg a game section that contains game rules

#hades includes default handlers for basic resources like textures
